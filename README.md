# Popular-Moves-Part1

#About
A simple movie app that pulls information about movies from a server, and displays a list of movies. In addition, the app can display more details about a movie if the user clicks on the image to a movie. 

#Usage
The main page should be a list of pictures of popular movies. The user can click on the settings icon on the top right of the app
to sort movies by either most popular or best reviewed. If the user clicks on a movie thumbnail, they can get details about that
particular movie, such as its release date, rating, and a basic synopsis of the movie.
